# American Express Anti-Steering in Two-Sided Markets (Ohio v. American Express)

**Course:** ECON 142CW ‚Äî Industrial Organization III (UCI)  
**Focus:** Legal, economic, and policy implications of the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision on anti-steering provisions in a two-sided platform.

## Abstract
This paper evaluates American Express‚Äôs anti-steering rules through the lens of two-sided market theory. I explain why the Supreme Court required plaintiffs to demonstrate net harm across both sides (cardholders and merchants), discuss cross-side network effects and market definition challenges, and outline enforcement implications for platform cases.

## Key takeaways
- Two-sided market framing can shift the burden of proof and remedy design.  
- Traditional tools (e.g., SSNIP on one side) can mislead when cross-side effects are strong.  
- The ruling likely raises the bar for future platform antitrust cases.
