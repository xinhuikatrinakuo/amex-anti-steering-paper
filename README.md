# American Express Anti-Steering in Two-Sided Markets (Ohio v. American Express)

**Course:** ECON 142CW ‚Äî Industrial Organization III (UCI)  
**Focus:** Legal, economic, and policy implications of the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision on anti-steering provisions in a two-sided platform.

## Abstract
The American Express anti-steering case (***Ohio v. American Express, 2018***) redefined how U.S. courts evaluate competition in two-sided markets (platforms that connect two distinct user groups), such as credit cardholders and merchants. From 

This paper analyzes how **anti-steering provisions** (which limit merchant steering to lower-fee cards) influence competition and consumer welfare, and how the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision reshaped **antitrust enforcement** for platform industries. And it examines:
- Payment card network structure and **cross-side network effects**  
- The **legal reasoning** behind the Supreme Court‚Äôs majority and dissent  
- **Economic tradeoffs** between platform coordination and merchant autonomy  
- **Policy implications** for digital platforms (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Play, Uber)

## Key takeaways
- Two-sided market framing can shift the burden of proof and remedy design.  
- Traditional tools (e.g., SSNIP on one side) can mislead when cross-side effects are strong.  
- The ruling likely raises the bar for future platform antitrust cases.
